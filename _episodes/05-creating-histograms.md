In this episode, we will learn how to use skimage functions to create and
display histograms for images.

## Introduction to Histograms

As it pertains to images, a *histogram* is a graphical representation showing
how frequently various colour values occur in the image.
We saw in
[the _Image Basics_ episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/02-image-basics.md %})
that we could use a histogram to visualise
the differences in uncompressed and compressed image formats.
If your project involves detecting colour changes between images,
histograms will prove to be very useful,
and histograms are also quite handy as a preparatory step before performing
[thresholding]({{ page.root }}/07-thresholding).

## Grayscale Histograms

We will start with grayscale images,
and then move on to colour images.
We will use this image of a plant seedling as an example:
![Plant seedling](../data/plant-seedling.jpg)

Here we load the image in grayscale instead of full colour, and display it:

~~~
import imageio.v3 as iio
import numpy as np
import skimage.color
import skimage.util
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib widget

# read the image of a plant seedling as grayscale from the outset
image = iio.imread(uri="data/plant-seedling.jpg", mode="L")

# convert the image to float dtype with a value range from 0 to 1
image = skimage.util.img_as_float(image)

# display the image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image, cmap="gray")
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Plant seedling](../fig/plant-seedling-grayscale.png)

Again, we use the `iio.imread()` function to load our image.
The first argument to `iio.imread()` is the filename of the image.
The second argument `mode="L"` defines the type and depth of a pixel in the
image (e.g., an 8-bit pixel has a range of 0-255). This argument is forwarded
to the `pillow` backend, for which mode "L" means 8-bit pixels and
single-channel (i.e., grayscale). `pillow` is a Python imaging library. The backend 
of `pillow` is used by `iio.imread()` and it may be specified (to use `pillow`, you would`
pass this argument: `plugin="pillow"`); if unspecified, `iio.imread()`
determines the backend to use based on the image type.

Then, we convert the grayscale image of integer dtype, with 0-255 range, into
a floating-point one with 0-1 range, by calling the function
`skimage.util.img_as_float`.
We will keep working with images in the value range 0 to 1 in this lesson.

We now use the function `np.histogram` to compute the histogram of our image
which, after all, is a NumPy array:

~~~
# create the histogram
histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(image, bins=256, range=(0, 1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

The parameter `bins` determines the number of "bins" to use for the histogram.
We pass in `256` because we want to see the pixel count for each of
the 256 possible values in the grayscale image.

The parameter `range` is the range of values each of the pixels in the image can have.
Here, we pass 0 and 1,
which is the value range of our input image after transforming it to grayscale.

The first output of the `np.histogram` function is a one-dimensional NumPy array,
with 256 rows and one column,
representing the number of pixels with the intensity value corresponding to the index.
I.e., the first number in the array is
the number of pixels found with intensity value 0,
and the final number in the array is
the number of pixels found with intensity value 255.
The second output of `np.histogram` is
an array with the bin edges and one column and 257 rows
(one more than the histogram itself).
There are no gaps between the bins, which means that the end of the first bin,
is the start of the second and so on.
For the last bin, the array also has to contain the stop,
so it has one more element, than the histogram.

Next, we turn our attention to displaying the histogram,
by taking advantage of the plotting facilities of the `matplotlib` library.

~~~
# configure and draw the histogram figure
plt.figure()
plt.title("Grayscale Histogram")
plt.xlabel("grayscale value")
plt.ylabel("pixel count")
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])  # <- named arguments do not work here

plt.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram)  # <- or here
~~~
{: .language-python}


We create the plot with `plt.figure()`,
then label the figure and the coordinate axes with `plt.title()`,
`plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()` functions.
The last step in the preparation of the figure is to
set the limits on the values on the x-axis with
the `plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])` function call.

> ## Variable-length argument lists
>
> Note that we cannot used named parameters for the
> `plt.xlim()` or `plt.plot()` functions.
> This is because these functions are defined to take an arbitrary number of
> *unnamed* arguments.
> The designers wrote the functions this way because they are very versatile,
> and creating named parameters for all of the possible ways to use them
> would be complicated.
{: .callout}

Finally, we create the histogram plot itself with
`plt.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram)`.
We use the **left** bin edges as x-positions for the histogram values by
indexing the `bin_edges` array to ignore the last value
(the **right** edge of the last bin).
When we run the program on this image of a plant seedling,
it produces this histogram:

![Plant seedling histogram](../fig/plant-seedling-grayscale-histogram.png)

## Colour Histograms

We can also create histograms for full colour images,
in addition to grayscale histograms.
We have seen colour histograms before,
in [the _Image Basics_ episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/02-image-basics.md %}).
A program to create colour histograms starts in a familiar way:

~~~
# read original image, in full color
image = iio.imread(uri="data/plant-seedling.jpg")

# display the image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We read the original image, now in full colour, and display it.

Next, we create the histogram, by calling the `np.histogram` function three
times, once for each of the channels.
We obtain the individual channels, by slicing the image along the last axis.
For example, we can obtain the red colour channel by calling
`r_chan = image[:, :, 0]`.

~~~
# tuple to select colors of each channel line
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

# create the histogram plot, with three lines, one for
# each color
plt.figure()
plt.xlim([0, 256])
for channel_id, color in enumerate(colors):
    histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(
        image[:, :, channel_id], bins=256, range=(0, 256)
    )
    plt.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram, color=color)

plt.title("Color Histogram")
plt.xlabel("Color value")
plt.ylabel("Pixel count")
~~~
{: .language-python}


We will draw the histogram line for each channel in a different colour,
and so we create a tuple of the colours to use for the three lines with the

`colors = ("red", "green", "blue")`

line of code.
Then, we limit the range of the x-axis with the `plt.xlim()` function call.

Next, we use the `for` control structure to iterate through the three channels,
plotting an appropriately-coloured histogram line for each.
This may be new Python syntax for you,
so we will take a moment to discuss what is happening in the `for` statement.

The Python built-in `enumerate()` function takes a list and returns an
*iterator* of *tuples*, where the first element of the tuple is the index and the second element is the element of the list.

> ## Iterators, tuples, and `enumerate()`
>
> In Python, an *iterator*, or an *iterable object*, is
> something that can be iterated over with the `for` control structure.
> A *tuple* is a sequence of objects, just like a list.
> However, a tuple cannot be changed,
> and a tuple is indicated by parentheses instead of square brackets.
> The `enumerate()` function takes an iterable object,
> and returns an iterator of tuples consisting of
> the 0-based index and the corresponding object.
>
> For example, consider this small Python program:
>
> ~~~
> list = ("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
>
> for x in enumerate(list):
>     print(x)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> Executing this program would produce the following output:
>
> ~~~
> (0, 'a')
> (1, 'b')
> (2, 'c')
> (3, 'd')
> (4, 'e')
> ~~~
> {: .output}
{: .callout}

In our colour histogram program, we are using a tuple, `(channel_id, color)`,
as the `for` variable.
The first time through the loop, the `channel_id` variable takes the value `0`,
referring to the position of the red colour channel,
and the `color` variable contains the string `"red"`.
The second time through the loop the values are the green channels index `1` and
`"green"`, and the third time they are the blue channel index `2` and `"blue"`.

Inside the `for` loop, our code looks much like it did for the
grayscale example. We calculate the histogram for the current channel
with the

`histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(image[:, :, channel_id], bins=256, range=(0, 256))`

function call,
and then add a histogram line of the correct colour to the plot with the

`plt.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram, color=c)`

function call.
Note the use of our loop variables, `channel_id` and `c`.

Finally we label our axes and display the histogram, shown here:
